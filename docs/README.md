# Currency Conversion
This is a simple currency conversion application that allows users to convert between different currencies.

The application uses the [ExchangeRate-API](https://api.currencybeacon.com/) to get the latest exchange rates.

# Technologies used
This application can be build using much simpler technologies,
however as a technology demonstrator, you will find things admittedly are a bit more spiced up to reflect the tech stack of a bigger web app.

- `Vite` as the build tool
- `Node`, make sure you have the correct Node version. This application uses Node version 20.18.0.
You can use `nvm` to manage your Node versions. After you have the correct node version, you can run `nvm use 20.18.0` to use the correct version.
- `React` for the frontend
- `TypeScript` for static type checking
- `Material-UI`, a popular React component library to take advantage of the pre-built components
- `TailwindCSS`, a utility-first CSS framework to style the application
- `PostCSS`, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins

3. Create your own API key from [https://currencybeacon.com](https://currencybeacon.com/register) and use it to replace the `API_KEY` in the `.env` file
